    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium eggplant, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>5 ½ tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 bulb garlic</li>
        <li>¼ cup tahini (sesame seed paste)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon lemon zest</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong> Sprinkle cut sides of eggplant with salt. Let stand for 20 to 30 minutes. Blot dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong> Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong> Brush cut sides of eggplant with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Cut off the top 1/4 inch from the garlic bulb, exposing the cloves. Brush cloves with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil and wrap bulb in aluminum foil. Place eggplant and garlic in the air fryer basket.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong>Cook in the preheated air fryer until eggplant and garlic are tender and eggplant is deep golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and allow to cool, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong>Scoop flesh from eggplant and place into the bowl of a food processor. Add tahini, lemon juice, 4 cloves of roasted garlic (reserve remaining roasted garlic for another use), remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil, cumin, and paprika; pulse to a moderately smooth consistency. Top with feta cheese, parsley, and lemon zest.</li>
    </ol>
