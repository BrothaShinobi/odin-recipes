    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul><strong>Sugars:</strong> You'll need white sugar for the cake and confectioners' sugar for the frosting.</ul>
        <ul><strong><Oil:</strong> A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds moisture without imparting flavor.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Eggs:</strong> Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the carrot cake batter together.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Vanilla:</strong> Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake (and one teaspoon for the frosting) enhances the flavor.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour creates structure and brings the batter together.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Leaveners:</strong> Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cake rise.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Cinnamon:</strong> Ground cinnamon adds that warm, cozy flavor you associate with carrot cake.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Salt:</strong> Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cake taste salty.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Carrots:</strong> Of course, you'll need grated carrots!</ul>
        <ul><strong>Pecans:</strong> Chopped pecans give the cake and frosting a pleasant crunch.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Butter and cream cheese:</strong> Butter and cream cheese are the key ingredients in the light and fluffy cream cheese frosting.</ul>
